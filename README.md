Predict Good and Bad loan from Lending Club dataset   
This is the task that had been given to me from ID/X Partners as Virtual Intern   
My task is to predict whether the customer belongs to the category of good creditor or bad creditor 
There many features, and some of them contains data leakage from the future, so I choose the feature carefully, based on the description   
To evaluate my model, I use ROCAUC Score
